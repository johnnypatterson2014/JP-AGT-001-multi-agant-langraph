{'online_researcher': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Report on Agentic Behavior\n\nThe concept of agentic behavior, particularly in the context of artificial intelligence (AI), revolves around the autonomy, reasoning, and adaptability of AI systems. Understanding the levels of agentic behavior in AI can help in comprehending how these artificial agents evolve from basic rule-following entities to fully autonomous, creative entities capable of making independent decisions and solving problems. The progression of AI systems towards more complex and independent functioning mirrors developments in autonomous vehicles (AVs), where autonomy is achieved through a gradual accumulation of capabilities.\n\n#### The Six Levels of Agentic Behavior in AI\n\n1. **Level 0: Rule-Based Workflow (Follower)**\n   - Characteristics: Relies on simple if-this-then-that logic without any intelligence, independence, or decision-making capability.\n   - Examples: Traditional automation systems, such as Zapier workflows.\n\n2. **Level 1: Basic Responder (Executor)**\n   - Characteristics: Processes inputs and generates responses based on patterns. Lacks agency, with purely reactive behavior without memory or iterative reasoning.\n   - Limitations: No control loop or self-directed decision-making.\n\n3. **Level 2: Use of Tools (Actor)**\n   - Characteristics: Executes tasks by deciding to use external tools, incorporating results into outputs. Marks the beginning of some level of execution decision-making.\n   - Challenges: Requires mechanisms to avoid incorrect information ("hallucinations").\n\n4. **Level 3: Observe, Plan, Act (Operator)**\n   - Characteristics: Maps out and sequences actions based on dependencies, evaluates and adjusts outcomes before proceeding.\n   - Limitations: Lacks the ability to set its own goals or operate indefinitely.\n\n5. **Level 4: Fully Autonomous (Explorer)**\n   - Characteristics: Maintains state across sessions, autonomously initiates workflows, and refines execution strategies in real-time.\n   - Status: Early development stages, with limitations on reliability and adaptive capabilities.\n\n6. **Level 5: Fully Creative (Inventor)**\n   - Characteristics: Creates its own logic, builds tools on-the-fly, and solves unanticipated problems, showing true creativity and independence.\n   - Future Goal: Achieving this level requires models capable of genuine reasoning beyond training data regurgitation.\n\n#### Current State of AI Systems in Agentic Behavior\n\nThe majority of today\'s AI systems are operating at Level 1, focusing on orchestration and optimization of model interactions. As AI development progresses, Level 2 is where significant advancements are occurring, with startups leading the push towards more intelligent multi-stage workflows. Levels 3 and 4 remain largely theoretical due to the current limitations in both model capabilities and infrastructure to support genuine autonomy.\n\nThis framework for understanding agentic behavior underscores the incremental nature of AI\'s evolution towards full autonomy. It highlights the complexity involved in creating AI agents that can truly operate independently, revealing the challenges in moving beyond current levels towards fully autonomous and creative AI systems.\n\n#### Moving Forward with Vellum\n\nVellum AI is addressing these challenges by providing tools and methodologies designed to test, evaluate, and refine AI workflows. Their approach aims to support the development of AI agents across the spectrum of agentic behavior, from basic rule-based systems to fully autonomous entities. By fostering a deeper understanding of AI capabilities and limitations, Vellum AI contributes to advancing the field towards the realization of fully autonomous and creative AI agents.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='online_researcher')]}}

{'blog_manager': {'messages': [HumanMessage(content='### Draft for Blog: Unveiling the Potential of Agentic Behavior in AI\n\n#### Introduction to Agentic Behavior\n\nIn the realm of artificial intelligence (AI), understanding agentic behavior opens doors to the future, where AI doesn\'t just follow commandsâ€”it thinks, decides, and innovates. This journey from basic automation to creating independent AI agents capable of solving complex problems on their own is not just fascinating; it\'s revolutionary.\n\n#### Exploring the Levels of AI Autonomy\n\nAI\'s evolution can be visualized through the lens of agentic behavior, divided into six progressive levels, each marking a significant leap towards true autonomy.\n\n**Level 0 - The Basic Follower:** Here, AI systems resemble traditional automation tools, rigidly following predefined rules without any real intelligence or independence.\n\n**Level 1 - The Executor:** These systems still lack agency, responding to inputs in a programmed, reactive manner without memory or iterative learning.\n\n**Level 2 - The Actor:** At this stage, AI begins to use external tools to execute tasks, showing an early form of decision-making in task execution. However, they are prone to misinformation and "hallucinations."\n\n**Level 3 - The Operator:** AI now plans and sequences actions, exhibits a controlled loop of action, and adjusts based on outcomes but doesn\'t self-initiate goals.\n\n**Level 4 - The Explorer:** This level sees AI maintaining knowledge across sessions, initiating workflows, and adapting strategies in real-time, moving closer to genuine autonomy.\n\n**Level 5 - The Inventor:** The pinnacle of AI agentic behavior, where AI systems exhibit true independence and creativity, creating solutions and tools on-the-fly.\n\n#### The Journey Toward True AI Autonomy\n\nToday\'s AI landscape largely spans Levels 1 and 2, where basic orchestration and the first signs of autonomous decision-making manifest. Vellum AI and similar innovators are pushing boundaries towards Levels 3 and 4, although true autonomy remains on the horizon, hindered by current technological and theoretical limitations.\n\n#### The Role of Vellum AI in Navigating the Future\n\nVellum AI stands at the forefront of this exploration, providing essential tools and insights aimed at nurturing the growth of AI agents from simple rule-followers to creative inventors. Their work not only highlights the challenges but also charts a course for overcoming them, promising a future where AI\'s potential is fully realized.\n\n#### Conclusion: The Road Ahead\n\nThe quest for agentic behavior in AI mirrors the broader aspirations of technology to serve humanity in profound, innovative ways. As we step into this future, understanding and nurturing these levels of autonomy will dictate how quickly and successfully we transform these aspirations into realities.\n\n**Unlocking the future of AI** requires patience, innovation, and a deep appreciation for the journey of agentic behavior from simplicity to the zenith of creativity and independence.\n\nAs we continue to navigate this exciting terrain, the potential for AI to evolve beyond our current comprehension and capabilities remains boundless. With initiatives like those led by Vellum AI, we\'re not just witnessing the future of artificial intelligence; we\'re actively shaping it.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={}, name='blog_manager')]}}
